<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi, I am Ebru, nice to meet you!</h2>

<hr />

<p>I am a business lawyer currently living in Rosenheim, Germany.</p>

<p>I gathered my first experiences studying with Udemy, while applying all the new stuff I learned to this Portfolio. <br />
    I noticed my passion for Web Development by accident. This is why I decided to learn how to create beautiful Websites in my free time.</p>

<p>This Homepage is supposed to be my Project for showing and saving the actual state of my studies.</p>

<p>I hope you like it!</p>
